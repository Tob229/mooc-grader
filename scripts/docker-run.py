# Orders a container using docker run command. Prerequisites:
# 1. Docker is installed on the computer.
# 2. Mooc-grader must listen at public IP (e.g. runserver 0.0.0.0:8080).
#
# The container must make an HTTP POST request including fields
# points, max_points, and feedback (HTML) to $REC/container-post.
#
# RUNNER_MODULE settings:
#   network: the network under which to run the container. Must be the same network
#       as mooc-grader is running on, if it is running in a container.
#   mount: dictionary of absolute container (mooc-grader) paths to absolute host paths. Must
#       contain enough information to determine locations of exercise, submission and
#       personalized directories. omit or set to {"/": "/"} if running mooc-grader outside a container
